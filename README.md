# Fruitback
Fruitback is on Rails.
Fruitback is an opensource projekt.
Fruitback helps you to collect feedback from users of your webapp.

## Info
During a seminar called "agile web development" in 2013 our task was to create a webapp using ruby on rails. Our customer wanted us to develop an open-source alternative to sites like UserVoice, UseRespone or getSatisfaction. At first, we needed a special name for our project and we decided to name it "fruitback", because of the idea, that users can give their feedback - in case they got upset of your site - by throwing scruffy fruits at you (of course "fruit-back" is quit similar to "feed-back").
Fruitback is a ruby on rails project. It allows you to host a feedback-service where other homepage-providers can sign in and create forums and feedback widgets for their sites.
